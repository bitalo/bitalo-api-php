# Bitalo API PHP Client Library

Using this PHP library you can connect to Bitalo private APIs. With these, you can currently:

* utilize Bitalo authentication, so users can log in to your site using their Bitalo accounts

* create and check status of payment requests

## Usage

Please refer to `-example` directories for examples how to use the APIs.
